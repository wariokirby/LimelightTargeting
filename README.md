This code allows tracking of april tags with a limelight.  It will find horizontal and vertical angle of target and the ability to switch pipelines.
Each pipeling will need to hold a different apriltag signature
This will also calculate horizontal range to target, but can be adjusted to find the hypotenuse and therefore the direct range to target
